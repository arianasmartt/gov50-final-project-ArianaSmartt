## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to how religious views impact policy preferences. I'm wondering how religiosity and opinions about issues like government welfare interact. I'm also wondering how religiosity impacts party attachment. The data I'm interested in is ANES survey questions from 1956-2020. This data allows me to look at trends in voting patterns and religiosity over time.
